(Yeah, all tests are not fixed yet...)

h2. Testing

Since we need some accounts for testing and we can't expose them in public, you have to create a properties file in src/main/test named "accounts.properties". A template is already present in the folder, just remane it "accouts.properties" and fill the blank inside.

<pre>
# BrainTree
braintree.merchantId=xxxxx
braintree.publicKey=xxxxx
braintree.privateKey=xxxxx
			
# AuthorizeNet 
authorizenet.apiLoginId=xxxxx
authorizenet.transactionKey=xxxxx
</pre>
